# Boreal Birds Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for exploring Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) bird population and habitat model outputs across boreal North America. The project focuses on improving accessibility and interactivity for BAM model visualizations by replacing static outputs with dynamic maps, charts, filters, and summary metrics.

This initiative is a partnership between Masters of Data Science (MDS) students at the University of British Columbia (UBC), in collaboration and consultation with the Boreal Avian Modelling Centre (BAM). 

## Features

- Interactive raster map visualizations
- Bird species and region filters
- Summary charts and tables
- Exploration of BAM model outputs (v4, v5, and future versions)
- Jupyter Notebook based exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Shiny-based dashboard prototype

# Data Notes

The project uses:

- GeoTIFF raster files (.tif)
- CSV observation datasets
- Excel metadata files

Large raster files may require preprocessing into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) for improved performance.
